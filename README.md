# askesian.net website

This is the repo for my personal website, [askesian.net](http://askesian.net).

The `development` branch is used for, well, development, and a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) [task](https://github.com/shinnn/gulp-gh-pages) is used to deploy the files to the `master` branch. This keeps the master branch clean, such that it only contains the files that are needed to display the website. All of the files for building, compiling, and optimizing are kept in the `development` branch.
