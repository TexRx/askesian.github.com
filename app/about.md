Thanks for visiting my site. It's made by [@askesian](https://twitter.com/askesian).

You can checkout some of the stuff that I work on by visiting my personal [GitHub](https://github.com/askesian) page, or my company's public [GitHub](https://github.com/onenorth) profile. Unfortunately, about 90% my code is tucked away inside my company's private [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) account, so you can't see any of that.

## Fun Stuff
This site was created using some of the following cool technologies:

* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
* I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host the site.
* All code written using my favorite editor, [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* Most of the time, I blocked out all external noise with a fair amount of [God is an Astronaut](https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=God%20is%20an%20Astronaut) while creating the site.

If you're interested in knowing more about the site, please checkout out [this sites GitHub repo](https://github.com/askesian/askesian.github.com) or [reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/askesian).

Thanks!
